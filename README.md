# Dragon Ball Super Card Game Maker

I play the Dragon Ball Super Card Game TCG with some friends. We enjoyed making our own silly cards but it was a pain to make them in Paint, so I decided to make something specialized. With this website you can easily create your own Dragon Ball TCG cards.

I am completely unafiliated with Akira Toriyama, DragonBall, Bandai, etc. etc. Please do not try to use this software to make counterfeit cards to trade to kids. First, that's cruel. Second, I do not have the fonts anywhere close to accurate enough. Just don't. This is meant to be for fun only.  

## Site

You can see the live site [here](http:shenwrong.com/).

## Local Development

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.8.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. 
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## On my to-do list:
- update this readme lol
- make first three digits of power smaller
- Fix card text font
- Add ability to create leaders
- Add ability to create extra cards
- Add dual colored cards + Arrivals + Aegis
- Add ability to add cost symbols in card text area
- Add ability to remove all auto highlighting in case it screws up
- Add brighter yellow skill button (for awaken, etc.)
- Find a way to auto highlight numbers for skills that have costs (ex. sparking, over realm)
- On text highlight, if color is too light, switch text color to black
- Fix bug where card text shows over image editing
