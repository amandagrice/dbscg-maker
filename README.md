# Dragon Ball Super Card Game Maker

![](./images/goku.jpg)

## Description

I play the Dragon Ball Super Card Game TCG with some friends. We enjoyed making our own silly cards but it was a pain to make them in Paint, so I decided to make something specialized. With this website you can easily create your own Dragon Ball TCG cards.

I am completely unafiliated with Akira Toriyama, DragonBall, Bandai, etc. etc. Please do not try to use this software to make counterfeit cards to trade to kids. First, that's cruel. Second, I do not have the fonts anywhere close to accurate enough. Just don't. This is meant to be for fun only.  

## Site

You can see the live site at [shenwrong.com](http:shenwrong.com/).

The name is supposed to be a pun on the dragon [Shenron](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Shenron) and "wrong" because the cards are fake. Idk, I'm not very funny.

Here's a screenshot of the site being used to turn a classic Yu-Gi-Oh Egyptian God into a broken Dragon Ball card.

## Local Development

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.8.

To get this up and running locally:

  `git clone https://github.com/amandagrice/dbscg-maker`
  
  `cd dbscg-maker`
  
  `npm install`
  
  `ng serve`
  
Then navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Current Features:

- Can create battle cards of any single color (black, blue, green, red, yellow).
- Can set the total cost and specified cost (except for black cards) to any number.
- Can set the combo power to 0, 5000, or 10000 and make it cost 0 or 1 to combo.
- Can set the card art to any image saved to your computer. Accepts most image formats.
- Can set the battle power to any number. 
- Can set the card text to any text. 
- Can add costs into the card text. 
- Can highlight keyword skills in the card text. The website can automatically find keywords to highlight, or you can set them yourself. 
- Can set the character, special trait, and era of the card. 
- Can download the image. 

## To-Do List:

### Major Features:
- Add ability to create leader cards.
- Add ability to create extra cards.
- Add dual-colored cards.

### Minor Tweaks:
- Make the last three digits of power smaller to match real cards.
- Fix card text font to match real cards better.
- Add ability to remove all auto-highlighting in case it screws up.
- Find a way to auto highlight numbers for skills that have costs in the name. (ex. sparking, over realm)
- Add dark mode
